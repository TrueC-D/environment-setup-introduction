# Local Environment Setup

## Introduction

When you first start learning to code the amount of setup you have to do to get
your computer ready to really make something can be frustrating. However, you
are no longer just starting to learn. It is now time to setup your local
environment!

The following lessons contain instructions for installing and configuring your
computer with the tools you'll be using for the remainder of the course. This includes:

- Setting up Git locally and connecting it to your personal GitHub account.
- Installing Ruby and the Ruby Version Manager
- Installing and connecting the Learn gem
- Installing Rails
- Installing Node and the Node Version Manager for JavaScript

Instructions for Mac and Windows users are provided in separate lessons, so make
sure to only follow the directions for your operating system.

We won't be using all of these tools immediately, but might as well get them
configured now so you'll be able to jump right in when you get to Rails and
JavaScript.
